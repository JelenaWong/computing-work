People call it a distraction. But I violently disagree. To me and my fellow directioners (?), it is an escape, a hideaway, our *home*. A place where we find comfort in being around clowns like ourselves. A plcae where we share tears of euphoria, tears of longing, even tears of heartache because we fell in love with their love and dammit they deserved better.  Where we unite as the greatest team that the world has ever seen.
